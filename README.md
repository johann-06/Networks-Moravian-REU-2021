# REU2021 - Random Race

## SageMath - mybinder Integrated
Included here are the neccesary files to get a sagemath kernel working on binder. [This link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rodrigoReyrios/Networks-Moravian-REU-2021/2b90d417f2eda514b0d5ed295f0a76a2f1be99dd) allows someone to have acces to an online Jupyter notebook session where you can play around with the contents of the repo in sage (although sometimes slow). The benefit here being someone can play around with any scripts we make without having to set up an enviroment or an IDE.

## Example Notebooks
Inlcuded in the GeneralExamples/ folders are variouse notebooks which the original creator of this repo made. These serve as tutorials for sage, partI, gap, etc.
